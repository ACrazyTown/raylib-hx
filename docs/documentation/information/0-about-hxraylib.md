title: About hxRaylib
---
hxRaylib is a binding over the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) game library which allows you to use the [haxe](https://www.haxe.org/) programming language. The goal is to build ontop of the binding to make it more accessible to novice developers. hxRaylib is still in a work in progress state and should not be used for anything in production.
